**About Me**
I mainly work with the Spring Framework and Spring Boot, building backend services and REST APIs. I also use Python for machine learning and AI, including building APIs with FastAPI and integrating large language models.

Currently, I’m refreshing and strengthening my skills in:

- Spring Boot for backend development and clean API design
- Python for Machine Learning and AI use cases
- React.js (18) to improve my understanding of frontend and be able to build microfrontend 

Next, I plan to focus on backend service and AI model deployment.

👯 I’m open to collaboration and mentorship, seeking guidance to grow both professionally and personally.
